## Description

I created this repository with the intention of learning AWS Amplify. Following the instructions provided in the AWS documentation, I successfully set up a simple Todo project.

## Usage

Users have the ability to create an account, and upon doing so, a verification code will be sent to their email address. By copying and pasting the received code, users can successfully verify their account. Afterward, they can proceed to log in and begin writing notes.
